This is going to cover why I chose Gatsby and the steps and decisions I made writing this site.

## My reasons for Gatsby

I chose to go with Gatsby and use it as a chance to try Typescript.

I began with the starter found [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gperl27/Gatsby-Starter-Blog-Typescript/).
This includes all features from Gatsby's official starter blog, with some other good stuff which is detailed on the page.

## Features

- [Adding markdown page template](###adding-page-template)
- [Scroll Tracking](#scroll-tracking)
- [Contact Form](#contact-form)

### Adding page template <a name="adding-page-template"></a>

A first requirement I wanted was to be able to render markdown through a page template, clearly divided from the blog template provided.

### Scroll tracking

### Contact Form

### Blog Tags

### Adding reCAPTCHA to contact form
