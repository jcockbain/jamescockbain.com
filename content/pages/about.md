### Me

Hi, I'm James and this is my website.
I currently work as a software developer within IBM cloud.

### About this website

The site itself is written in Gatsby with Typescript, the code is at [github.com/jcockbain/jamescockbain.com](https://github.com/jcockbain/jamescockbain.com).
I've also written a short post on setting it up at [/blog/building-a-blog-site-with-gatsby](https://www.jamescockbain.com/blog/building-a-blog-site-with-gatsby/).

Please feel free to get in touch and let me know what you think!
