Hi, I'm James and this is my website.

 <!-- This is what I look like on holiday.

![Me on holiday](./profile-picture.jpg "me") -->

I'm an IBM Cloud software developer holding a master's degree in
physics, I enjoy applying my analytical and problem-solving skills in
the dynamic technology industry.

I currently specialise in Node.js and
have professional experience working with Go, Docker and React. I also
have experience with Python, Kubernetes and Typescript.
