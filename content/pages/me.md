## Me

Hi, I'm James and this is my website.

I currently work as a software developer within IBM cloud.

Most recently, I've been working on an open source project aiming to enhance the development of cloud-native applications in containers. If you're interested, more on that [here](https://www.eclipse.org/codewind/).


## Aim for this website

I started this website because I want to share my own experiences and learn in the open.

It's written in Gatsby with Typescript, in interested you can find the code [here](https://github.com/jcockbain/jamescockbain.dev).

With that in mind, please feel free to get in touch and let me know what you think!
