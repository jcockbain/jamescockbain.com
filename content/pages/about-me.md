### Me

Hi, I'm James and this is my website.
I currently work as a software developer within IBM cloud.

Most recently, I've been working on an open source project aiming to enhance the development of cloud-native applications in containers.
If you're interested, more on that at [eclipse.org/codewind](https://www.eclipse.org/codewind/).

### Aim for this website

I started this website because I want to share my own experiences and learn in the open.
The site itself is written in Gatsby with Typescript, the code is at [github.com/jcockbain/jamescockbain.com](https://github.com/jcockbain/jamescockbain.com).
I've also written a short post on setting it up at [/blog/building-a-blog-site-with-gatsby](https://www.jamescockbain.com/blog/building-a-blog-site-with-gatsby/).

Please feel free to get in touch and let me know what you think!
